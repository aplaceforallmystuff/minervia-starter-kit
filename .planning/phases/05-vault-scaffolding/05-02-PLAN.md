<objective>
Add example notes and wire scaffold_new_vault() into main installation flow

Purpose: Example notes help users understand each PARA folder's purpose. The main scaffolding function orchestrates folder/template/example creation and must be called at the right point in the installation flow, gated on IS_NEW_VAULT.

Output: Working vault scaffolding integrated into installer

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add create_example_notes function</name>
  <files>install.sh</files>
  <action>
Add create_example_notes() function after create_templates().

Create example notes in each PARA folder using heredoc. Each note should:
- Explain the folder's purpose
- Be clearly marked as deletable examples
- Use wiki links to demonstrate Obsidian linking (where appropriate)

**1. Inbox (01 Inbox/Welcome to your Inbox.md):**
```markdown
# Welcome to your Inbox

This folder is for quick capture - ideas, links, notes that haven't been organized yet.

**How to use:**
1. Capture anything here without worrying about organization
2. During your weekly review, process items:
   - Move to appropriate PARA folder
   - Delete if no longer relevant
   - Add to a project or area

**Tip:** Keep the inbox small. If it grows too large, it becomes overwhelming.
```

**2. Projects (02 Projects/Example Project.md):**
```markdown

# Example Project

> Delete this file once you understand the structure.

## Overview

Projects have a **deadline** and a clear **definition of done**. When complete, move them to Archive.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] All criteria met = project complete

## Next Actions

- [ ] First actionable step
- [ ] Second step (add as you go)

## Notes

Add meeting notes, research, decisions here.

- [[Example Area]] - The area this project supports

**3. Areas (03 Areas/Example Area.md):**
```markdown

created: 2025-01-01
tags: [area, example]

# Example Area

> Delete this file once you understand the structure.

## Purpose

Areas are **ongoing responsibilities** without end dates. Examples:
- Health
- Finances
- Career
- Relationships
- Home

## Standards

What does "good enough" look like for this area?

- Standard 1
- Standard 2

## Current Focus

What aspects need attention right now?

## Related Projects

- [[Example Project]]
```

**4. Archive (05 Archive/About the Archive.md):**
```markdown
# About the Archive

This folder holds **completed projects** and **inactive items**.

**When to archive:**
- Project is complete (all success criteria met)
- Area is no longer relevant
- Reference material is outdated but worth keeping

**Archive structure:**
Some people organize by year (Archive/2025/), others keep it flat. Do what works for you.

**Remember:** Archived doesn't mean deleted. You can always search or move things back.

Print green + for each example created.
  </action>
  <verify>Read install.sh and confirm create_example_notes() creates 4 example files</verify>
  <done>create_example_notes() function creates examples in Inbox, Projects, Areas, and Archive</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add scaffold_new_vault function and wire into main flow</name>
  <files>install.sh</files>
  <action>
Add scaffold_new_vault() function after create_example_notes().

The function should:
1. Check IS_NEW_VAULT - if not "true", print yellow skip message and return 0
2. Print "Creating PARA folder structure..."
3. Call create_para_folders
4. Print "Creating templates..."
5. Call create_templates
6. Print "Creating example notes..."
7. Call create_example_notes
8. Print green checkmark "Vault scaffolding complete"
9. Print yellow tip about Obsidian Templates configuration:
   "Settings > Core plugins > Templates > Template folder: 04 Resources/Templates"

Then wire scaffold_new_vault() into the main installation flow:
- Find the line calling detect_vault_type (around line 923)
- Add scaffold_new_vault call AFTER detect_vault_type, BEFORE the Obsidian vault check

The main flow should be:
```bash
# Detect vault type (new vs existing)
detect_vault_type

# Create PARA structure for new vaults
scaffold_new_vault

# Check if this is an Obsidian vault
if [ -d ".obsidian" ]; then
```
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Read install.sh and confirm scaffold_new_vault() exists with IS_NEW_VAULT gate
2. Confirm scaffold_new_vault is called between detect_vault_type and the .obsidian check
3. Run: bash -n install.sh (syntax check passes)
  </verify>
  <done>scaffold_new_vault() orchestrates folder/template/example creation, wired into main flow after detect_vault_type</done>
</task>

</tasks>
