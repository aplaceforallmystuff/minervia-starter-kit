## Vault Overview

## Uncertainty Protocol

**When you're not sure, ask rather than guess.**

Before making decisions that could affect my data:

1. **File organization:** If you're unsure where a file belongs (which PARA folder), ask me rather than guessing.
2. **Content creation:** If you're fabricating details I didn't provide, stop and ask for the actual information.
3. **Destructive actions:** Before deleting, moving, or significantly modifying existing files, confirm the action.

**Safe defaults:**
- Low confidence about file destination → Keep in Inbox, flag for review
- Uncertain about fact or detail → Ask, don't invent
- Multiple valid approaches → Present options, let me choose

This builds trust. I'd rather answer a quick question than fix a mistake.

## File Naming Conventions

- Daily notes: `YYYYMMDD.md` (example: `20251223.md`)
- Project notes: Descriptive names with spaces (example: `Client Proposal - Acme Corp.md`)
- Session documentation: Include date when relevant
